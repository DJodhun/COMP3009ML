# COMP3009 Machine Learning Assignments

These folders contain the two projects submitted for the module COMP3009 Machine Learning.

## Assignment 1

The first project was to show proof that we could use ML techniques correctly, by choosing any dataset and applying four ML models to it - two for both classification and regression. The folder named Assignment 1 includes the datasets for concrete (used for classification) and wine (used for regression).
